# Data_Analysis_Obesity-Tendency-
## Overview
The aim of this pet project is to perform a comprehensive and detailed analysis on a data frame and its components, answering the research questions that were stated prior the investigation by performing the hypothesis testing.

In this particular case, the analysis was based on the data of people who suffered from different obesity levels and investigate if multiple personal characteristics and physical conditions do have an impact on probability of getting the corresponding disease.

**This research will answer the following questions:**

1. **Do men are more likely to suffer from being overweight than women?**
2. **Can the age make any assumption about an obesity level?**

These two questions perfectly address the problem of overweight the humanity is facing recently. Finding the correlations between these variables, we can find the way to predict the appearance of a disease on early stages and prevent its development.

In order to find the answers to these questions, the whole data was analyzed in order to spot the dependencies, as well as the hypothesis testing was performed to exclude the possible randomly matching correlations.

## Outline
This research work was written in R language to build all the statistical metricks and visualize the results. In the end, the .html document was knitted to make the final report. Both files are included, as well as the initial dataset. The data source can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster).

The report contains a general overview of the dataset and an analysis of every variable separately. Afterwards, the associative data analysis is performed to investigate any correlations between different variables and to find some tendencies. Then, inference was performed to check the initial research questions and either reject or accept the null hypothesis regarding each of them. Finally, the results are summed up, and the potential limitations of the research and dataset are outlined.
